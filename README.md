# willgiff

this is the 6th week project for coding boot camp (has it really) been that long?) 
  the project populates a page with one of four pre-selected categories of giphy clickable animations when it's button is clicked, and allows user to add new buttons with their own choices of button type. It also displays the 'rating' under each giphy.
